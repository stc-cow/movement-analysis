/**
 * useChat Hook - DEPRECATED
 * 
 * This hook was originally designed to make API calls to a backend chatbot service.
 * 
 * ❌ NO LONGER USED - Use COWMovementChatbot directly instead
 * 
 * The COWMovementChatbot class (in @/lib/cowMovementChatbot) provides a fully
 * client-side implementation that doesn't require any backend API calls.
 * 
 * See: client/components/COWMovementChat.tsx for the proper implementation
